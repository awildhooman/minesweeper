 # Minesweeper
This is a terminal-based minesweeper game. It allows you to customize the dimensions of the board and the percentage of mines.

To make a move, type the x-coordinate followed by the y-coordinate, followed by the action ('d' for revealing a square and 'f' for placing/removing a flag). You win when all the non-mine squares are revealed.
